<h2>A little about myself.</h2>

<p>Hi. My name's Matěj Grabovský and I'm a 14 years old Buddhist Czech male wannabe-programmer.</p>
<p>P = NP would also have big implications in mathematics. One could find short, fully logical proofs<!--
--> for theorems but these proofs are usually extremely long. But we can use the Occam razor<!--
--> principle to recognize and verify mathematical proofs as typically written in journals.<!--
--> We can then find proofs of theorems that have reasonable length proofs say in under 100 pages.<!--
--> A person who proves P = NP would walk home from the Clay Institute not with $1 million check<!--
--> but with seven (actually six since the Poincaré Conjecture appears solved).</p>
<p>So you have an NP-complete problem you just have to solve. If, as we believe,<!--
--> P ≠ NP you won't find a general algorithm that will correctly and accurately<!--
--> solve your problem all the time. But sometimes you need to solve the problem anyway.<!--
--> All hope is not lost. Here, I describe some of the tools one can use on NP-complete<!--
--> problems and how computational complexity theory studies these approaches.<!--
--> Typically one needs to combine several of these approaches when tackling NP-complete problems in the real world.</p>
