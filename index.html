    <div class="central">
        <p>Hello, my name is Matěj Grabovský and I am a self-proclaimed web developer
        and all-around coder living in a small town in Czechia. I am a friendly guy
        with generally positive attitude towards anything related to computer
        science, programming and computers. My areas of interest besides web stuff
        include the theory of programming languages, formal methods, and foundations
        of mathematics. I like clean, minimalistic code and languages that allow
        writing it.</p>

        <p>I have six years of experience in website development, both on the front
        and back end. I am comfortable with modern technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3,
        and many of the contemporary JavaScript libraries (primarily jQuery and d3)
        as much as with vanilla JavaScript.</p>

        <p>On the server side, I am used to running Apache HTTPD or nginx on
        Unix-based systems. I oft use PHP, although I do not fear saner languages,
        such as Python, Ruby or JavaScript. Regarding data storage, I am familiar
        with relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite) as well as “NoSQL”
        (specifically MongoDB; alternatively Redis and memcached for fast key–value
        storage).</p>

        <p>I have a very good knowledge of PHP and JavaScript, decent understanding
        of C and Python, and a mild knowledge of C++. I focus mainly on web and
        command line interfaces. However, I have experience creating GUI applications
        with the Qt and wxPython frameworks.</p>

        <p>My editor of choice is (Neo)Vim with a base16-based colorscheme.
        I prefer UTF-8, spaces for indentation, one space after full stop, and UK
        spelling.</p>

        <p>I have a fairly wide range of interests: among others, mathematics,
        physics, logic, foreign languages, photography, hiking, and
